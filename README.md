# SRM_Encoding_model_fMRI_align
This repository provides code and processed features for constructing GPT-2 XL–based stimulus representations from the Pie Man narrative dataset. The pipeline converts transcripts into word- and TR-level embeddings, applies PCA dimensionality reduction, and builds lagged feature matrices for encoding model experiments.

The data used in this analysis are derived from the Narratives dataset available at
